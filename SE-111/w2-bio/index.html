    </h2>
    <p>
         My name is Austen, I am 29 years old and a student at NEIT studying Network Engineering.
        I grew up moving back and forth between South Carolina and Florida. 
        I moved to New England when I was 18 when I joined the Navy and served 4 years in the Submarine Service. 
        I currently work for Amtrak as an equipment operator in track construction.
        My plan is to move back to Florida after I graduate.
