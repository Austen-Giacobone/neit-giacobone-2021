                 <em>Days of Thunder</em> was a staple movie of my childhood.
                 <br>
                 My family being huge <b>NASCAR</b> fans, this movie played in our house on repeat all day. 
                 <br>
                 Cole Trickle is a new young driver trying to make his name on the NASCAR circuit. 
                 <br>
                 Team owner Tim Deland wants Cole to drive for him, but Cole needs a crew chief.
                 <br>
                 Harry Hodge retired the year before due to his last driver dying in a wreck at Daytona the previous year.
                 <br>
                 Tim convinces Harry to crew for Cole and race against his big rival, Rowdy Burns.
                 <br>
                 Rowdy and Cole get into a devastating wreck and are both sent to the hospital where Cole meets DR. Claire.
                 <br>
                 Since Rowdy is no longer able to race due to a brain injury, he supports Cole by giving him his car for the Daytona 500.
                 <br>
                 Cole goes on to win the Daytona 500.

                <h3>Trivia</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Production began without a finished script. Scenes were often written the day of filming.
                        <br>During one driving sequence, Tom Cruise actually had to read his lines off cue cards attached to his windshield, which resulted in a minor car accident.
                        <br> For subsequent driving sequences, Cruise was fitted with a special earpiece to have lines fed to him.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        The movie was conceived by Tom Cruise when he and Paul Newman were allowed to test one of Rick Hendrick's race cars.
                        <br> Tom's first lap was in excess of one hundred eighty miles per hour.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        According to Dale Earnhardt, Jr., Tom Cruise had a meeting with Dale Earnhardt, Sr. prior to the production of the film. 
                        <br>It was rumored that Earnhardt was offered the role of Rowdy Burns, but he turned it down because he did not want to play the bad guy.
